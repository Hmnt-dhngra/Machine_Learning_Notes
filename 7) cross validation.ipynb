    "2) Leave p out CV : same as above, it's just you leave p records out for validation contrary to just 1 mentioned above. \n",

    "3) K-fold cross validation : Say you have a total of n=500 records and for k=5 , you will have 500/5=100 records. \n",
    "    - For experiment 1: we will have first 100 records as the validation data, rest 400 as the test data\n",
    "    - For experiment 2: we will have second 100 records as the validation data, rest 400 as the test data\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Stratified K -fold cross validation : There may be scenarios wherein only specific categories are in majority in the training or test data. This method ensures to have thevalidation data as somewhat having a balanced dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Time series cross validation : Cross validation is done on order of dates. This is usually done when we have a time series and we changed something like added features based on poor reviews and then possibly have better reviews over a range of time. "
