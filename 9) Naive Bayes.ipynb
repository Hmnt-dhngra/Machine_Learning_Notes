    "\n",
    "1) **Bernoulli NB** : Whenever your independant features are following a bernoulli distribution, then we need to use Bernoulli NB for the classification. The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models a single binary experiment—one trial with exactly two possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Multinomial NB** : Whenever your input data is in the form of text, you can use this for ex: Spam classificiation, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Gaussian NB** : If the features are following gaussian distribution, then we use this Gaussian Naive Bayes for classfication. A Gaussian distribution, also called the Normal distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that describes data which tends to cluster symmetrically around a central value (the mean), with frequencies tapering off equally on both sides. **Bell curve** Dataset needs to be **continuous**. \n",
