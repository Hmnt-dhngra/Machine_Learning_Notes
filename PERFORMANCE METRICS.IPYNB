    "**Standard Methods** : \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean absolute error (MAE)** -> Mean of absolute errors. \n",
    "    - MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.\n",
    "    - MAE treats all errors equally, regardless of their size. This means that it is **less sensitive to outliers** compared to MSE.\n",
    "    - **Interpretation** :  In a business context like stock price prediction, a MAE of 5 dollars implies that, on average, the prediction is off by 5 dollars. It's straightforward and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean squared error (MSE)** -> Mean of squared errors. \n",
    "    - MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors. \n",
    "    - It **accentuates (emphasize) larger errors more than smaller ones** since the errors are squared before they are averaged.\n",
    "    - MSE is **highly sensitive to outliers**. A few large errors can significantly increase the value of MSE, making it useful for models where large errors are particularly undesirable.\n",
    "    - The squaring is done to penalise the one having more error much analogous to the subject in which the student scored the least need to be focussed more because that subject has the most error i.e. deviation from the ideal i.e 100. Further square makes the error positive. \n",
    "    - **Interpretation** : An error of 5 dollars yields an MSE of 25 (since (5^2 = 25)). This amplification illustrates that MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily. Thus, MSE can overstate the impact of errors compared to MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root mean square error (RMSE)** -> The root of Mean of squared errors. \n",
    "    - RMSE is the square root of MSE\n",
    "    - It brings the error metric back to the same scale as the original data, which is not the case with MSE since it squares the errors.\n",
    "    - Used **when MSE is giving very large values**.\n",
    "    - RMSE is useful for its interpretability. Since it's on the same scale as the target variable, stakeholders can understand it more intuitively than MSE.\n",
    "    - **Interpretation** : if RMSE is 5, it means that the model's predictions are, on average, within 5 of the actual stock prices. It's more interpretable than an MSE of  25 (which is 5 squared), as it directly relates to the scale of the stock prices.\n",
