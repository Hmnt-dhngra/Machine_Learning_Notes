    "#### **Introduction to Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine teaching a child to recognize animals. You show them pictures of cats and dogs, telling them which is which. After seeing many examples, the child learns to identify new animals they've never seen before. Machine Learning works the same way!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a **subfield of artificial intelligence** that focuses on building systems that **learn patterns from data** and improve their performance over time **without being explicitly programmed for every scenario**. \n",
    "Instead of writing fixed rules, we provide data and allow algorithms to infer the underlying relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Was Machine Learning Needed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning emerged because traditional rule-based programming reached its limits in real-world problems. \n",
    "- Rule-Based Systems Do Not Scale\n",
    "    - Developers manually define rules: if condition → then action\n",
    "    - This works only when rules are simple, stable, and well-defined\n",
    "- Data became abundant\n",
    "    - With the rise of internet Sensors and IoT devices, Mobile applications, Enterprise systems we started generating massive volumes of data. If data is available, it is often easier and more effective to learn patterns from data than to hard-code expert knowledge. Machine learning leverages this data to automatically extract insights.\n",
    "- Many Problems Lack Explicit Algorithms\n",
    "    - Fraud detection, recommendation systems etc do not really have a clear logical solutionm and hence we cannot write determinitic algos , ML provides a way to approximate complex functions from input to output. \n",
    "- Improved Performance Over Time\n",
    "    - Unlike traditional programs ML models can improve as more data becomes available and Performance increases without rewriting code\n",
    "    - Example: Search engines, recommender systems, and voice assistants become more accurate as usage grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom Line :**  You should be able to take decisions backed by data. You cannot hard code all the complexities in terms of the coded logics . "

    "- Rule-Based Systems (1950s–1970s)\n",
    "    - Early AI relied on hand-crafted rules written by humans. These systems worked only for simple, well-defined problems and failed to scale to real-world complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical & Probabilistic Methods (1980s–1990s)\n",
    "    - Focus shifted to statistics and probability. Algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and Naive Bayes learned patterns from data rather than fixed rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classical Machine Learning (1990s–2010)\n",
    "    - More robust algorithms emerged, including SVMs, ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, random forests), and improved optimization techniques. ML became practical due to better computing power and data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Big Data & Feature Engineering Era (2010–2015)\n",
    "    - Explosion of data and distributed computing (Hadoop, Spark). Performance depended heavily on manual feature engineering combined with classical ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep Learning Era (2012–Present)\n",
    "    - Neural networks with many layers (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) enabled automatic feature learning. Major breakthroughs occurred in vision, speech, and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modern ML Systems (Present)\n",
    "    - Focus expanded beyond models to end-to-end systems: MLOps, scalable training, real-time inference, foundation models, and responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one line:\n",
    "Machine learning evolved from hand-coded rules → statistical learning → classical ML → deep learning → large-scale intelligent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** If machine learning was there from 1950s why do we see its increased usage now?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "- Amount of data increased significantly \n",
    "- Computation power increased drastcially recently \n",

    "\n",
    "Learning simply means finding patterns and when these are done automatically (by the machine) we call this process machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 methods in which the machine is learning \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised learning** : As the name suggests -- supervised!! means you gonna have some teacher. (labelled data i.e. input - output pairs)\n",
    "  - When members of a team need feedback of the supervisor to confirm if they are doing the work correctly. \n",
    "  - Similarly understand the Features as questions and the target as the answers , so we are telling the machine that so is the answer when this question comes up.\n",
    "  - Features are like the input variables or known as independant variables. \n",
    "  - Targets are the labels or the known output or the ground truth also known as the dependant variable. \n",
    "  - Example : For deciding the income in a new job, you will need to know the applicant's age, years of experience and tech stack, hence all these are indepdant and these together defines the income which is why income is dependant\n",
    "  - Real life examples: House price prediction, Eligible for credit card\n",
    "  - Question we ask from ML model: Given data, **predict some answer**\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning** : Learning without labels. \n",
    "  - The model finds hidden patterns on its own, and then makes groups like grouping similar customers together. \n",
    "  - Features --> ML --> groups.\n",
    "  - Question we ask from ML model: Given the data, **segment into the groups.**   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning** : Closest to how the humans learn. \n",
    "  - An agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.\n",
    "  - Example : Autonomous cars, robotics, playing chess, etc. \n",
    "  - Won't be used ever in our jobs. \n",

    "- A teacher wants to evaluate whether a student is smart or not. \n",
    "- She teaches 10 questions to the students. \n",
    "- Now there are 2 methods to identify : Give same 10 questions in the test or give new questions in the test \n",
    "    - If the students is asked those same 10 questions, they moght have memorised them and give a false image of being smart i.e. they can perform 100%. \n",
    "    - For hollistic evaluation of a student it is important to have completely new questions because it checks thorough understanding.\n",
    "- Similarly when we provide data to the model and asks it to learn the patterns, it can memorise all the existent patterns and perform 100% perfect, but when that will be given new data , it **might** underperform. \n",
    "- In order to avoid this, we split the data into two parts, one of which the model will see and learn from called Train dataset and the other it doesn't see which is called test dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "This process of dividiing the data into 2 (or 3) parts is called **Data Splitting**\n",
